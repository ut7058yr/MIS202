            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) has reduced communications costs and is now widely used by businesses</li>
                <li>Email programs can be used to send text and multimedia messages to cell phones</li>
                <li>Web conferencing is becoming increasingly common, and helps businesses save money</li>

            <p>
                For this assignment  set up a Skype conference call involving  members of your D2L Summative05 group.<br />
                You can arrange to call group members on their Internet Skype account, at their cell phone number or at both.
                <br />
                It would be a good idea to try a combination of these two to see how things work.
                <br />
                Spread out so that all participants are outside of voice range of each other.
                <br />
                Use the study room, empty class rooms, your living space or whatever.
                <br />
                For best results make sure to use either ear buds, or better yet, a headset.<br />
                If you wish, try this several times, feel free to try it outside of class time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose a topic before you attempt the conference call.
                <br />
                Try something like 'the benefits of conference calling' or 'net neutrality' or some  mutually agreeable business topic such as 'web conference calls'
    <br />
                <br />
                Each student must answer the following questions regarding the conference call.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. (50) What were the  best 2 factors in the conference call?
                <br />
                Possible choices are voice delay, or lack thereof, call volume, clarity....

                Online communications,  collaboration and file sharing<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                Login to D2L to find  your Summative05 group number and group members.<br />
                Then check out this page to find your <a href="https://eprofessor.azurewebsites.net/helpfiles/virtualmeetingrooms.htm" class="bg-info text-white" target="_blank">Meeting Room</a> web address.<br />
                The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to collaborate and share  files using Adobe Connect.<br />
                <br />
                Your group will work to develop a  PowerPoint presentation.<br />
                Each group member must contribute  the following  screen shots taken from within your Adobe Connect meeting room.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the &quot;Share-My Computer Screen.... &quot; pod to display your favorite web site to meeting participants, and take a screen shot.</li>
                <li>Use the &quot;Chat&quot; pod to write a comment to all meeting participants, and take a screen shot.</li>
                <li>Use the &quot;File Share&quot; pod to upload the PowerPoint presentation that your group is creating for this assignment, and take a screen shot.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The group decides the order in which members contribute to the presentation. Or the first person to get into the meeting room can begin the process.<br />
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first person begins creating the PowerPoint presentation</li>
                <li>First create a title slide listing the members, and the word 'present' after their name if they were in class. </li>
                <li>Then make the three screen shots-Computer Screen, Chat, File Share. </li>
                <li>Each screen shot put on a PowerPoint slide must contain the person's name.</li>
                <li>Save the PowerPoint with NO spaces or non-standard characers in the file name, otherwise you will be sorry.  </li>
                <li>The next group member downloads the PowerPoint from the File Pod, adds their three screen shots detailed above, each as a separate PowerPoint slide.  </li>
                <li>An example slide title would be &quot;Pat Paulson File Share&quot;  </li>
                <li>When that person is done, again save the PowerPoint and upload it to the File Share pod, so that the process continues until all group members have completed their work.</li>
                <li>Continue until all group members are done.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Note: it is strongly suggested that the person making the screen shots share their desktop with the group members so they can watch and assisst.
      <br />

            <p>
                If a group member or members are not in class (and will be penalized), contact them and tell them to do their three slides before the assignment is due, noting that they must download the PowerPoint presentation, contribute their screen shots/PowerPoint slides, and upload the completed file.<br />
                Note that when each group member finishes adding their slides to the presentation, they take a copy of the PowerPoint presentation,   print it as a .pdf file, and create a hyperlink below.<br />
                Do not worry if a group member does not do their screen shots/PowerPoint slides-the rest of the group will not be penalized.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your group meeting room should look like this, if not please let Professor Paulson know so that he can correct the Pod layout:<br />

                <br />
                .<br />
                Here is an example showing all three Pods in one screen shot (you will have 3 separate screen shots):<br />
                <img src="PPTX_screenshot.jpg" alt="screen share" class="img-responsive" /><br />
